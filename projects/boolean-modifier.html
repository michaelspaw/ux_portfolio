            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <div class="project-section__content">
                <p>Our goal for the Boolean Modifier was to modernize a longstanding legacy tool, that while powerful, was deficient in both reliability and UX. Modelers would use the existing tools with reservations as it often failed with complex geometry. The current design also forced users to create brand new geometry vs working with the existing geometry in the stack, 3dsMax's procedural workhorse leading to a lack of proceduralism and fluidity of creation and exploration.</p>
                <p>Our high-level goals were to:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Integrate the Boolean workflow as a modifier allowing for seamless non destructive creation within the 3dsMax modifier stack.</li>
                    <li>Deliver flawless results consistently allowing for intense production heavy dependability. And turn a tool of last resort into an essential tool for hard-surface modeling.</li>
                    <li>Create a UX that allows for more fluidity in creation and modification, keeping the modeler more in the viewport vs having to traverse to the command panel to adjust settings and modify the actions.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
        </section>

        <section class="project-section">
            <h2>Understanding the Problem</h2>
            <div class="project-section__content">
                <p>Traditional boolean operations in 3dsMax can produce unpredictable results with complex geometry, requiring extensive cleanup and manual adjustments. Artists need a more reliable and intuitive solution that keeps them in the modeling flow, maintains clean topology and provides better control over the operation results.</p>
                <p>While we knew these were deficiencies we wanted to address, it was critically important that we did the research to guarantee we were on the right track and if there were important issues we had missed we would have a full understanding of the problem space.</p>

            <h2>The Work</h2>
            <div class="project-section__content">
                <p>I led the design of a new boolean operation system that introduced several key innovations:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Real-time preview of operation results</li>
                    <li>Advanced topology preservation algorithms</li>
                    <li>Intuitive control over operation parameters</li>
                    <li>Non-destructive workflow integration</li>
